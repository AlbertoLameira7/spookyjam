2D Horror project

main features:
  - Exploration (besides the typical 2D, add different layers of rooms to give it a sense of depth)
  - Flashlight mechanics
  - Shooting mechanics (not main focus, should be very limited and scarce bullets, only as last resort)
  - Aiming should point towards current cursor position and move accordingly
  - Basic Inventory system
  - Dialogue system (read notes, interact with objects)
  - Some puzzles
